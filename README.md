<!--
## Requirements
- Python3
  - NumPy
  - SymPy
  - Matplotlib
  - seaborn

## example
```txt
lqr.ipynb (while this can be solved easily by DARE)

## Note
This repository was made for author's studying DDP algorithm and Python programming. Since implemented in Python, its computational time is far behind in C/C++. JIT compilation via Numba or C++ code generation might be implemented in the future.
